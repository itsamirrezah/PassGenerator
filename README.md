# Pass Generator
An android application which generates strong passwords with different settings and quick setting tile.

### Motivation
Unfortunately [Firefox For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&hl=en) and [Lockwise](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/lockwise/) apps don't have an option to generate random passwords YET, so I build this little pass generator app for personal usage.

### Features
- [x] Ability to choose symbols, numbers and uppercase letters in the passwords
- [x] Add a quick setting tile for generating passwords (Android 7.0 Nougat or higher)
- [ ] Calculate the strength of passwords
